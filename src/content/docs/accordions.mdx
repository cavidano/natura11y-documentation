import AccordionExample from '../../components/docs/examples/Accordion';

<TextBlock>

Accordions are useful when a page covers several different topics. A good example would be an FAQ page. It's best to avoid using accordions to make long pages appear shorter.

</TextBlock>

<AccessibilitySpotlight>

All focusable elements in the accordion are included in the page <em>tab</em> sequence.

Accordions have keyboard support including <em>Tab</em> and <em>up</em> and <em>down</em> arrows.

When focused, accordion headers expand the panel with <em>space</em> or <em>enter</em> keys.

When clicked, accordion headers toggle the appropriate <em>aria-hidden</em> and <em>aria-expanded</em> attributes.

## Default Behavior

The following is a basic accordion component. All accordion panels are closed by default.

</TextBlock>

<FigureBlock
    figureNumber="1"
    highlightedLines="1,3-10,12-25"
    visualExample={(
        <AccordionExample />
    )}
    codeExample={(`
        <div class="accordion"> \n
            <button
                class="accordion__button h5"
                id="acc-button-example-01"
                data-toggle="accordion"
                aria-controls="acc-panel-example-01"
                aria-expanded="false">
                    Danaus Plexippus
            </button> \n
            <div
                class="accordion__panel"
                id="acc-panel-example-01"
                data-accordion="panel"
                aria-labelledby="acc-button-example-01"
                role="region"> \n
                <div class="accordion__panel__content">
                    <p>
                        The monarch butterfly or simply monarch is a milkweed butterfly in the family Nymphalidae. Other common names, depending on region, include milkweed, common tiger, wanderer, and black veined brown. It may be the most familiar <a href="#1">North American</a> butterfly, and is considered an iconic pollinator species.
                    </p>
                </div> \n
            </div> \n
            <!-- Repeat pair above as needed -->
        </div>
    `)}
/>

<TableLineDescBlock targetFigure="1">

<TableLineDescRow lines="1">

The parent `.accordion` class is required.

This selector uses JavaScript to group a set of topics (accordion headers) with one another.

</TableLineDescRow>

<TableLineDescRow lines="3-10">

The child `.accordion__button` selector is required.

The `id` attribute equals the value of its associated panel's `aria-labelledby` attribute.

The `data-toggle="accordion"` attribute is present on the accordion button for JavaScript purposes.

The `aria-controls` attribute equals its associated panel's `id` attribute. 

The `aria-expanded="false"` attribute is present on the button where its associated accordion panel should be closed when the page loads.

</TableLineDescRow>

<TableLineDescRow lines="12-25">

The child `.accordion__panel` selector is required.

The `id` attribute equals the value of its associated button's `aria-controls` attribute.

The `data-accordion="panel"` attribute is present on the accordion panel for JavaScript purposes.

The `aria-labelledby` attribute equals the value of its associated buttons's `id` attribute.

The `role="region"` attribute is present on the accordion panel for assistive technology.

The granchild `.accordion__panel__content` selector holds the panel's content. Padding applied to this selector allows a clean open and close transition, without using jQuery.

</TableLineDescRow>

</TableLineDescBlock>

<Divider id="semanticHeaders" />

<TextBlock>

## Semantic Headers

The the `.accordion__button` selector doesn't have to be a button tag. In fact, header tags in the accordion help describe the architecture of a page. For example, if an accordion group lives below a page's `<h1>`, the accordion headers could be `<h2>` tags.

</TextBlock>

<FigureBlock
    figureNumber="2"
    highlightedLines="2"
    codeToolbar={false}
    codeExample={(`
        <h2
            class="accordion__button h5"
            id="..."
            data-toggle="accordion"
            aria-controls="..."
            aria-expanded="false">
                Danaus Plexippus
        </h2>
    `)}
/>

<TextBlock>

In Figure 2 (line 2) notice the `.h5` class. Header utility classes are particularly useful in this example. When a semantic header (e.g. `<h1>`) needs to be smaller (in visual size) than its natural markup style. You can use <a href="/docs/typography/#sectionHeadings">header utilities</a> on non-semantic tags (e.g., `<button>`), that need the appearance of a header.

</TextBlock>

## Open by Default

You may want one of your accordion topics to be open by default (when the page loads), like the following example:

</TextBlock>

<FigureBlock
    figureNumber="3"
    highlightedLines="6,11"
    visualExample={(
        <AccordionExample openFirst={true} />
    )}
    codeExample={(`
        <button
            class="accordion__button h5"
            id="acc-button-id"
            data-toggle="accordion"
            aria-controls="acc-panel-id"
            aria-expanded="true">
                Danaus Plexippus
        </button>\n
        <div
            class="accordion__panel show"
            id="acc-panel-id"
            data-accordion="panel"
            aria-labelledby="acc-button-id"
            role="region">
            <div class="accordion__panel__content">
                ...
            </div>
        </div>
    `)}
/>

<TableLineDescBlock targetFigure="3">

<TableLineDescRow lines="6">

On the `.accordion__button` selector, set the `aria-expanded` attribute to `"true"`

</TableLineDescRow>

<TableLineDescRow lines="11">

On the related `.accordion__panel` selector, include the class `.show`.

</TableLineDescRow>

</TableLineDescBlock>
