<TextBlock>

Accordions are useful when a page covers several different topics. A good example would be an FAQ page. It's best to avoid using accordions to make long pages appear shorter.

</TextBlock>

<AccessibilitySpotlight>
All focusable elements in the accordion are included in the page <em>tab</em> sequence.

Accordions have keyboard support including <em>Tab</em> and <em>up</em> and <em>down</em> arrows.

When focused, accordion headers expand the panel with <em>space</em> or <em>enter</em> keys.

When clicked, accordion headers toggle the appropriate <em>aria-hidden</em> and <em>aria-expanded</em> attributes.
